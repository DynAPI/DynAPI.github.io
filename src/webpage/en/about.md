# About Us

DynAPI is an organization on GitHub.

Our main software is the [DynAPI](https://github.com/DynAPI/org.dynapi.dynapi) Server, but we also offer [other software](http://localhost:3000/#other-dynapi-software-packages) that can be used free of charge.

I'm too lazy to write more, but I hope this is enough information for you.
